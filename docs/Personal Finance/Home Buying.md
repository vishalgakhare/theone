## Terms
- EMI = Estimated Monthly Installment
- PMI = Private Mortgage Insurance (if downpayment < 20%) usually ~0.5%
- HOA = Housing Association, if you buy a house in a community.
- Downpayment = The % of the total cost. If it's <20%, the buyer needs to pay PMI.
- Earnest Money Deposit = If buyer is serious and makes an offer, the seller takes his property off the market and demands to pay the earnest money. The _Purchase Agreement_ is prepared with details on the total earnest money deposit and its payment schedule e.g. 5% of the $600k to be paid over 3 installments. If the deal falls through (unforeseen event, loan rejection), the seller may keep the deposit. If the deal goes through, the deposit is counted towards downpayment and/or closing cost.
- [Closing Cost](https://better.com/content/what-is-included-in-closing-costs/) = Loan Cost (origination charges + services borrower shop/did not shop) + Other Cost (tax + fees + initial escrow payment + other)

### Factors Impacting your mortgage rate
- Credit Score (Debt/Income ratio, On-time credit payment)

### Mortgage Rate Types
- fixed-rate 30/15 year conventional
- [adjustable-rate (ARM)](https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_charm_booklet.pdf) - quoted as fixed-period/adjustable-frequency e.g. 5/6 means interest rate is fixed for first 5 years and may change every 6-months until it is paid off.

### Risky Loan
- Balloon Payment - if the loan demands huge payment at the end of the loan term.
- Prepayment Penalty if you refinance or pay off your loan. Prepayment up to 20% of the balance is usually allowed.

### Points or Credits
- 1 point is 1% so 1 point of $100k is $1000
- zero-point loan - The lender takes or gives no point.
- When lender offers some points, it can be used against the closing cost.
- Sometimes the seller asks to use their preferred lender and doing so, offers some credit in closing cost.
- If you're planning to stay for longer time, prefer lower interest rate over the credits/points. 
- If you're planning to refinance or resell the house soon, get the credits/points _now!_
